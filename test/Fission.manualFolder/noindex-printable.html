    	<h1>What's New in Fission 2</h1>
      
        <p>Fission 2.0 is a major upgrade over previous versions, with many great new features. Read on for an overview of new functionality added since Fission 1. You can always return to this manual via the Start window or the Help menu.</p>

		<h3>Brand New Interface</h3>
 	      
 	    <p><img src="images/new-interface.png" style="width: 200px; height: 160px; margin:0px 15px 5px 15px;" align="right" alt="Sharp New Interface!"/>Every aspect of Fission has been examined and considered, with enhancements made across the board. If you haven't used Fission before, you'll find it's a snap to learn.</p>
 	    
 	    <p>If you <em>have</em> used Fission before, it will be instantly familiar, but very much improved. We've updated the graphics and interface, and also worked to streamline how the most common tasks are performed. Fission is easier and faster than ever.
 	    <br clear="all"></p>

		<h3>Multiple Windows</h3>
 	      
 	    <p><img src="images/new-manywindows.png" style="width: 200px; height: 160px; margin:0px 15px 5px 15px;" align="right" alt="Windows Galore!"/>Hallelujah! You can now open multiple files at once in Fission. Now you can copy and paste audio between files or just work on multiple items at the same time. 
 	    <br clear="all"></p>
 	    
		<h3>Cross-Format Conversions</h3>
 	      
 	    <p><img src="images/new-manyformats.png" style="width: 200px; height: 160px; margin:0px 15px 5px 15px;" align="right" alt="So Many Formats!"/>In addition to losslessly editing and saving a file in its original format, Fission can now also convert between formats. Save an AIFF file to MP3, a Apple Lossless file to AAC, or any other conversion you desire.
 	    <br clear="all"></p>
 	    
		<h3>Batch Converter</h3>
 	      
 	    <p><img src="images/new-batchconverter.png" style="width: 200px; height: 160px; margin:0px 15px 5px 15px;" align="right" alt="NAME"/>Not only can Fission save a single audio file between any of its audio formats, it can also transcode multiple files for you in an instant. Using Fission's Batch Converter, you can convert an entire folder's worth of audio files to a new audio format.
 	    <br clear="all"></p>

		<h3>Chapterized AAC Files</h3>
 	      
 	    <p><img src="images/new-chapterize.png" style="width: 200px; height: 160px; margin:0px 15px 5px 15px;" align="right" alt="Enhance your podcast!"/>Podcasters rejoice! Fission lets you make Enhanced Podcasts with AAC in just seconds. Just place splits to mark chapters, then add artwork and URLs for each chapter. Select "Save as Chapterized AAC", and you'll get a top-quality enhanced podcast file.
 	    <br clear="all"></p>
 	    
		<h3>SoundCloud Support</h3>
 	      
 	    <p><img src="images/soundcloud.png" style="width: 200px; height: 160px; margin:0px 15px 5px 15px; border: none;" align="right" alt="Soundcloud"/>If you're a SoundCloud user, you'll love Fission 2! Fission has full support for sharing directly to your SoundCloud account, making it a snap to get your audio files online.
 	    <br clear="all"></p>
 	    
		<h3>Full FLAC Support, and WAV too</h3>
 	      
 	    <p><img src="images/flac.jpg" style="width: 200px; height: 160px; margin:0px 15px 5px 15px; border: none;" align="right" alt="Fission <3s FLAC"/>FLAC users will be thrilled, as Fission can now read, edit and write FLAC files. While Fission has always supported the uncompressed AIFF format, as well as the losslessly compressed Apple Lossless format, many users have been asking for full FLAC support, and it's finally here. We've also added in full support for WAV audio files, just for good measure. That means Fission now has full support for the six most popular audio formats: MP3, AAC, Apple Lossless, FLAC, AIFF, and WAV.

	<div class="main">
		<div class="content">	
	       	<h1>Removing and Adding Audio</h1>
 	      
			<p>Fission can be used to remove audio from a file, as well as add new audio.</p>
		    	            
			<h3>Deleting Audio</h3>
		    
	        <p>Deleting audio is as easy as selecting and removing it. First, select the exact audio you wish to remove. You can tweak your selection by dragging either edge to increase or decrease the length. Alternately, the Set Selection option in the Tools menu will let you select an exact length of audio.</p>
	        
	        <p class="centeredimage">
				<img src="images/deletingaudio.png" style="width: 506px; height: 256px;" alt="A selection to be removed">
				<br>A selection of audio to be removed
			</p>				        
	        
	        <p>Once the audio is selected, you can delete it by clicking the Remove button in the toolbar, or by selecting Remove from the Clip menu. The selected audio will then be removed from the file. If you wish to automatically add fades into and out of the removed point, turn on the Fade Around Removed Audio option in the Clip menu. For more details on fading, see the <a href="volumeadjustment.html">Fades and Volume Adjustments</a> page for details.</p>
	        
	        <p class="centeredimage">
				<img src="images/removeandsplit.png" style="width: 114px; height: 63px;" alt="The Remove &amp; Split button">
				<br>Remove & Split button
			</p>				        
	        
	        <p>You can also use the Remove and Split function in the Toolbar or Clip menu, to add a split point between two pieces of audio. For more on split points, see the <a href="splitting.html">Splitting Audio</a> page.</p>
	        
			<h3>Cropping Audio</h3>
		    
	        <p>Cropping audio is also very straightforward. First, select the audio you wish to keep. Remember that you can tweak a selection by dragging either edge to increase or decrease the length, or set an exact selection with the Set Selection option in the Tools menu.</p>	        
	        
	        <p class="centeredimage">
				<img src="images/crop.png" style="width: 114px; height: 63px;" alt="The Crop Button">
				<br>The Crop Button
			</p>				        
	        
	        <p>Once the exact selection is made, the audio can be cropped by clicking the Crop button in the toolbar, or choosing Crop from the Clip menu. All other audio will be removed, leaving you with only the selected audio.</p>

			<h3>Adding Audio</h3>
		    
	        <p>Audio can be added to a file in two ways. First, if you wish to simply join two (or more) files together, you can drag and drop a file from the Finder into an already-open audio file. The second file will be added to either the beginning or end of the open file (depending on where you drop) as a separate clip, so that it can be easily moved and manipulated. To merge the two clips together, just highlight the split point separating them, and delete it.</p>
	        
	        <p class="centeredimage">
				<img src="images/join.png" style="width: 174px; height: 220px;" alt="File's being joined">
				<br>Two files can easily be joined into one
			</p>				        
	        
	        <p>Audio can also be pasted in between audio files. With multiple audio files open, you can select audio from one file and copy it out using the Edit menu. Switch windows to the destination file, and paste it in where desired. The audio will be inserted wherever the playhead is currently located, as a separate clip. Again, to merge the two clips together, just highlight the split point separating them, and delete it.</p>
	        
			<h3>Inserting Silence</h3>
		    
	        <p>Finally, Fission can add periods of silence to files, with the Insert Silence command. The Insert Silence sheet will appear:</p>		        
	        
	        <p class="centeredimage">
				<img src="images/insertsilence.png" style="width: 250px; height: 106px;" alt="Fissions's Insert Silence Sheet">
			</p>	        
			
			<p>With the settings seen above, 7.5 seconds of silence will be inserted where the playhead is currently located. Note that silence is added as a separate clip, so that it can be easily moved and manipulated. To merge the silence fully, just highlight the split points and delete them.</p>

	        </div>
	</div><!-- main-->
	


		

	
		
	<div class="main">
		<div class="content">	
	       	<h1>Splitting Audio</h1>
 	       	      
			<p>Fission can help you rapidly split one long audio file into multiple files.</p>		    	            
		    	            
			<h3>Split Points and Clips</h3>
			
			<p>Fission uses split points, or splits, to separate clips in an audio file. When a file contains multiple clips, the split points are what separate each clip. Saving a file with multiple clips results in multiple audio files being saved out.</p>
			
			<p>To adjust the length of a clip, just move the relevant split. Likewise, to merge two clips together, just remove the split point separating them.</p>
			
	        <p class="centeredimage">
				<img src="images/splitpoint.png" style="width: 134px; height: 262px;" alt="A split point in Fission">
				<br>A split point between two clips
			</p>						
			
			<h3>Adding Split Points</h3>
		     
	        <p>Adding a split point can be done in several ways. Generally, placing the playhead where you wish to split is the first step. You can click once in the main waveform to move the playhead, or simply play the file until the desired point. Once the playhead is in place, you can click the Split button in the Toolbar, or select Split at Playhead from the Clip menu. A split point will be inserted into the file, separating the audio into two distinct clips.</p>
	        
	        <p>If you know the exact timestamp where you'd like to split, you can also use the Add Split option in the Tools menu to add a precise split.</p>

			<h3>The Smart Split Tool</h3>
		    
       		<p>Fission's Smart Split tool can be used to automatically find split points in a file, based on where there are silences. This can be particularly useful for rapidly splitting up recordings from analog sources like records and tapes, as well as multi-song digital recordings. To access it, select Smart Split from the Tools menu:</p>		        
	        
	        <p class="centeredimage">
				<img src="images/smartsplit.png" style="width: 388px; height: 327px;" alt="Fissions's Smart Split Window">
				<br>Fission's Smart Split Window
			</p>
			
			<p>Smart Split identifies silences based on the settings selected and shows where it will place split points. When you click the Insert Splits button, the split points will be added to the file, creating multiple clips. If needed, adjust these splits by moving them, adding more, or removing any which are erroneous. Once you've got the split points set, save the audio out and you'll get a distinct file for each clip.</p>

	<div class="main">
		<div class="content">	
	       	<h1>Fades and Volume Adjustments</h1>
 	      
			<p>Fission can fade audio in and out, normalize an entire file, and adjust the gain of a portion of audio.</p>
			
			<h3>Fading In or Out</h3>
		    
	        <p>To fade audio, start by selecting the audio you wish to fade. Once a selection is made, click the Fade In or Fade Out buttons to fade the audio across the entire selection.</p>

	        <p class="centeredimage">
				<img src="images/fade.png" style="width: 124px; height: 60px;" alt="Fission's Fade Buttons">
				<br>Fission's Fade Buttons
			</p>			
	        
	        <p>As well, with the Fade Around Removed Audio option turned on in the Clip menu, you can set Fission to automatically fade around areas where audio has been removed. The duration of these fades can be adjusted in the <a href="preferences.html">Preferences</a> window.</p>

			<h3>Normalizing Audio</h3>
			
	        <p class="centeredimage">
				<img src="images/normalize.png" style="width: 94px; height: 60px;" alt="Fissions's Normalize Button">
				<br>Fission's Normalize Button
			</p>				
		    
	        <p>Normalize increases the gain of the selected audio, so that the loudest sample is at set to the maximum possible value. This makes the selection as loud as possible without causing distortion. To normalize a selection of audio, just highlight the desired audio then click the Normalize button.</p>	        			

			<h3>Gain Adjustment</h3>

	        <p class="centeredimage">
				<img src="images/dbslider.png" style="width: 59px; height: 149px;" alt="Fissions's Gain Adjustment Button">
				<br>Fission's Gain Adjustment Slider
			</p>				
		    
	        <p>You'll see the Gain Adjustment button at the bottom of any selection. Clicking and holding the button will bring up the Gain Adjustment slider. Just slide up or down to adjust the gain of the selection.</p>

	<div class="main">
		<div class="content">	
	       	<h1>Audio Format Conversion</h1>
 	      
			<p>While originally designed for lossless audio editing, Fission can also save audio between formats in a process known as transcoding. For example, you can edit an AIFF file and save it to MP3, or take a collection of FLAC files and convert them to AAC. Fission offers two ways to convert formats: you can export a single file to a new format, or perform a batch conversion of many files at once.</p>
			
			<p>Fission offers support for saving to MP3, AAC, Apple Lossless, FLAC, AIFF, and WAV, with defaults offering varying quality levels. Audio experts can even customize all settings using the Custom menu option. Remember that higher bitrates provide higher quality, but also create bigger files. For more details, see the <a href="audioformats.html">Audio Formats Overview</a> page.
		    	            
			<h3>Exporting</h3>
		    
	        <p>When you've got an audio file open, selecting Export from the file menu will bring up this sheet:</p>
	        
	        <p class="centeredimage">
				<img src="images/exportsheet.png" style="width: 408px; height: 288px;" alt="Fissions's Export Sheet">
			</p>
	
			<p>From this sheet, you can export a file to your desired format and Fission will save it out in seconds. You can also Export just a selection of a file, with the Export Selection option.</p>

			<h3>The Batch Converter</h3>
		    
	        <p>Fission's Batch Converter makes it easy to transcode multiple files at once. The Batch Converter can be opened from Fission's Start window, or by selecting Show Batch Converter from the Window menu.</p>	        
	        
	        <p class="centeredimage">
				<img src="images/batchconverter.png" style="width: 450px; height: 540px;" alt="Fissions's Batch Converter">
			</p>

			<p>In the Batch Converter window, you can add multiple files to the table at the top, then select the desired format and output location. Once that's set, clicking Convert will cause the files to be converted in sequence.</p>

	       	<h1>Creating iPhone Ringtones</h1>
 	      
			<p>The iPhone allows you to set custom sounds for when you receive a call or text, as well as for when an alarm goes off. You can even assign specific tones to individuals, so you can tell who's calling or texting without even looking at the phone. Using Fission, you can turn any audio file into a tone for use on the iPhone.</p>			
			
			<p>To get started, just open an audio file in Fission and select the audio you want for the ringtone. Once you have your audio selected, use the <a href="removingandadding.html">Crop function</a> to trim out any unwanted audio. Remember that iPhone ringtones need to be less than 40 seconds, and you'll likely want a very short (1-3 second) file for text tones.

			</p>			
						
							<p>After cropping down your audio, play it to confirm it's exactly what you want, then select Save as iPhone Ringtone from the File menu. Fission will then process the file and pass it directly to iTunes. Your new ringtone will immediately appear in the Tones section. Sync it over to your iPhone, and you can start using it immediately.</p>

 	      	<p>A chapterized AAC file is an AAC file which contains distinct sections called chapters. These chapters break a file up into multiple parts for improved navigation. Each chapter can contain its own artwork as well as a URL pointing anywhere on the web.</p>
 	      	
 	      	<p>Chapterized AAC files are often used by podcasters creating enhanced podcasts. They're great for allowing listeners to jump to a specific section, and additional information can be shared via the chapter's corresponding URL.</p>

			</p>			 	      	
 	      
 	      	<p>With Fission, creating a chapterized AAC file is easier than it's ever been before. To get started, take any audio file, and add <a href="splitting.html">split points</a> between each chapter you'd like to create.</p>
 	      	
	        <p class="centeredimage">
				<img src="images/chapterized2.png" style="width: 500px; height: 390px;" alt="Audio file split into Chapters">
				<br>This file will produce three distinct chapters, one for each clip.
			</p>			 	      	
 	      	 	      	
 	      	<p>Next, you'll edit the metadata for each chapter. Click the first chapter, then edit its title in the Tags tab. In the Podcasts tab, you can adjust the URL Title, URL, and artwork if desired. Do this for each chapter, until you've got all the relevant information entered.</p>

				<br>Edit metadata in the Inspector's Podcast tab
			</p>			 	    
 	      	
 	      	<p>Once this is set, just select Save As Chapterized AAC from the File menu. Fission will save the file out as a chapterized AAC file, ready for use with your podcast or anywhere else.</p>
 	      	
 	      	<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you're editing a file not already in the AAC format, Fission will automatically transcode it to 128 kbps 44.1 kHz AAC.</p>

	       	<h1>An Overview of Audio Formats</h1>
 	      
			<p>Fission works with six of the most popular audio formats: MP3, AAC, Apple Lossless, FLAC, AIFF, and WAV.</p>
		    	         
			<h3>Selecting an Audio Format</h3>
		    
	        <p>First, if you're unsure what audio format to save to, MP3 is likely a very safe bet. It will provide a very small audio file which can be played almost anywhere.</p>
	        
	        <p>If you don't want to lose any quality but still wish to save disk space or bandwidth when transferring the file, Apple Lossless is a good choice. If you want a lossless file which will play anywhere, AIFF or WAV are good choices.</p>	        
		    	         
		    <p>Finally, if you can avoid switching audio formats entirely (by simply saving, instead of exporting), you'll prevent quality loss from occurring. That said, transcoding between formats is certainly fine when a specific file format is required, and quality loss caused by transcoding is generally not problematic.</p>	  
		    
		    <p>For more information on each specific audio format, read below.</p>		    	         
		    	         
			<h3>MP3</h3>
		    
	        <p><img src="images/batch_MP3_selected.png" class="sideimage-left" style="width: 78px; height: 68px;" alt="MP3 icon">MP3 is the most popular format for audio compression, making it the most universal file type; MP3 files can be played almost anywhere. MP3 files are compressed lossily, meaning some audio quality may be lost when they're created. However, the files are also very compact, using only a small amount of disk space.</p>
	        
	        <!-- <p>The Variable Bit Rate (VBR) option for MP3 files allows the software to dynamically adjust the bitrate of the encoding, to save disk space without additional quality loss. Some audiophiles dislike the results of VBR encodings, however.</p> -->
	        
			<h3>AAC</h3>
		    
	        <p><img src="images/batch_AAC_selected.png" class="sideimage-left" style="width: 78px; height: 68px;" alt="AAC icon">Though not as universal as MP3, AAC is another well-known format for audio compression, popularized by Apple. As such, AAC files play well on the Mac and iOS devices, but may not be as easy to play elsewhere. Like MP3, AAC files are compressed lossily, meaning some audio quality may be lost when they're created. AAC files are generally even more compact than MP3, using less disk space for the same level of quality.</p>
	        
			<!-- <p>The High-Efficiency (HE-AAC) option for AAC files allows allows the software to compress encoding even further, to save disk space without additional quality loss. HE-AAC is limited to low bitrates (24 - 80 kbps) and a compatible player is needed to play the audio back optimally.</p> -->	        

			<h3>Apple Lossless</h3>
		    
	        <p><img src="images/batch_ALAC_selected.png" class="sideimage-left" style="width: 78px; height: 68px;" alt="ALAC icon">As you might expect, the Apple Lossless format was created by Apple. It's a lossless compression format, which means that even though the files are shrunk down in size, no audio quality is lost. Though they are compressed to around half the size of uncompressed AIFF/WAV files, these files will still be quite large. They'll play on all iOS devices and in iTunes, as well as in many applications on the Mac.</p>
	        
			<h3>FLAC</h3>
		    
	        <p><img src="images/batch_FLAC_selected.png" class="sideimage-left" style="width: 78px; height: 68px;" alt="FLAC icon">FLAC is an open competitor to Apple Lossless. Like Apple Lossless, it offers lossless compression, creating large files of around half the size of uncompressed AIFF/WAV files but losing no quality. FLAC is a popular format for web distribution of lossless audio. Unfortunately, FLAC files currently require special plugins or players on the Mac, and do not play on iOS devices. Fission makes it easy to convert files out of the FLAC format, if you desire.</p>
	        
			<h3>AIFF/WAV</h3>
		    
	        <p><img src="images/batch_AIFF_selected.png" class="sideimage-left" style="width: 78px; height: 68px;" alt="AIFF icon"><img src="images/batch_WAV_selected.png" class="sideimage-left" style="width: 78px; height: 68px;" alt="WAV icon">AIFF and WAV are twin uncompressed audio formats, which generally work identically. While AIFF was once used largely on the Mac platform and WAV used largely on Windows, they're now each compatible on both platforms. These files have no compression, so they're enormously large, but as with Apple Lossless and FLAC, no quality is lost. AIFF and WAV files will play in almost any audio player.</p>
