	       	        <h1>Purchasing Fission</h1>
        
        <p><b>Quick Link</b>: To buy a license key for Fission, visit our <a href="http://rogueamoeba.com/store/">online store</a>.</p>

		<h3>Why should I buy Fission?</h3>
		<p>Put simply, you should buy Fission because it isn't free - we give you a chance to test out the program and all its features before you buy it. It's like test driving a car, for as long as it takes you to decide.</p> 

		<p>In trial mode, all of Fission's features are available to try, but it won't work for full-time use. During the trial, the quality of audio saved through Fission will be degraded through a series of audio fades. 

		<p>If you use Fission and find you like it, please purchase a license key - support the software you use and love!</p>

		<p>To purchase your license key, just visit <a href="http://rogueamoeba.com/store/">http://rogueamoeba.com/store/</a>.</p>
		
		<h3>What about upgrades?</h3>
		<p>Fission 2 is a paid upgrade from version 1.
		
		<p>If your license key starts with <tt>YELO-</tt>, it's valid for Fission 2. Just enter it to unlock Fission, and enjoy!</p>
		
		<p>If you purchased a license for Fission before April 1st, 2012, you can <a href="http://rogueamoeba.com/fission/buy.php?type=upgrade">purchase a heavily discounted upgrade to Fission 2</a>.</p>				
		
		<h2>After Purchase</h2>

		<h3>How do I unlock the full version?</h3>
		<p>When you download Fission from our site, you're receiving a free trial of the software. To get the full, unlimited version, you just need a valid license key to unlock it. When you purchase through our store, you'll immediately receive a license key in your browser, as well as via email. This key will allow you to unlock the full version of Fission. Simply enter your key into Fission as instructed, and you'll be all set.</p>

		<h3>What's your upgrade policy?</h3>
			
		<p>Our philosophy regarding paid upgrades is simple: <strong>We try to do what's right for you and what's right for us.</strong></p>

		<p>Rogue Amoeba doesn't have a hard and fast upgrade policy, just a great track record. Since 2002, across our entire product line, we've provided dozens of major updates and hundreds of new releases total, free of charge.</p>

		<p>If we add substantial new functionality, we may charge an upgrade fee. However, we do not make most of our income from recurring sales, and we provide nearly all updates free of charge, including both bug fixes and new features. Finally, when an upgrade fee is charged, we even grandfather in a generous amount of recent purchases with free upgrades.</p>

		<h3>What's your refund policy?</h3>
		<p>All Rogue Amoeba products are available as demos for an evaluation prior to purchase. We believe that no customer should have to buy software in order to find out how well it works. Our software can be fully evaluated with no limitations in capabilities, prior to purchase. Customers are <b>strongly encouraged</b> to take advantage of these trials prior to purchase. You may also seek any needed technical support from us - we answer support emails rapidly and responsively for current and potential customers alike.</p>

		<p>If you would like a refund, please contact <a href="mailto: hello@rogueamoeba.com">hello@rogueamoeba.com</a> within 14 days of your purchase. Because we cannot recover the license key that was sold, refunds are issued on a case-by-case basis.</p>
